### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Christina Lytle!

Theatre Artist turned Software Developer with back-end and front-end skills dedicated to creating, maintaining, and testing interactive user-focused software. I am a lifelong learner with the drive to challenge myself and a desire to impact the world around me. Iâ€™ve had to collaborate with team members throughout my career to solve complex problems while performing quickly and accurately under pressure. Iâ€™m drawn to tech because of the challenging work, collaborative environment, and endless learning and creativity opportunities.

My passion for software development started when I worked in marketing implemented new websites for two of my companies. I became fascinated with the process and started to learn HTML on my own so I could upkeep the websites after they were implemented, later becoming the webmaster at the charter school. The opportunity came to go to coding school, and I took it and never looked back. My familiarity with database analysis and design, collaborating with team members to reach department and revenue goals, and advanced customer service skills gained from my theatre management and marketing experience have been crucial in my software development career.
